![ezEditor](../editor/media/ezEditor.jpg)

ezEditor is the central application for authoring content and bringing existing assets together. It includes a scene editor, functionality for working with [meshes](../graphics/meshes/meshes-overview.md), [textures](../graphics/textures-overview.md), [materials](../materials/materials-overview.md), [particles](../effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md) and [sounds](../sound/sound-overview.md), as well as a [visual shader editor (TODO)](../materials/visual-shaders.md), [visual scripting](../custom-code/visual-script/visual-script-overview.md) and [prefabs](../prefabs/prefabs-overview.md). The editor transforms [assets](../assets/assets-overview.md) from source data into the optimized runtime formats and keeps track which assets are up to date.

The editor can also [run the game logic](../editor/run-scene.md) inside the viewport while making edits, or start a complete play-the-game mode which lets you experience your creation without delay.

The runtime functionality of the editor lives in a separate engine process, which makes the editor very robust. If the engine crashes, the editor can just relaunch it within a second, without loss of work and with minimal interruption.

## Compiling the Editor

The editor currently only builds on Windows and requires Qt. See [Building ezEngine](../build/building-ez.md).
