# API Docs

The C++ engine source is relatively well documented using Doxygen comments.

## Online API Docs

The C++ API documentation is available online at [**ezEngine.GitHub.io/api-docs**](https://ezengine.github.io/api-docs).
Note that this documentation is only updated for full [releases](https://github.com/ezEngine/ezEngine/releases).

## Generating the Docs locally

If you need the latest up-to-date source documentation, you can easily generate the Doxygen documentation locally. A *Doxyfile* can be found under **_PathToEzRepository_/Documentation/Doxyfile**

## ReadTheDocs.org

We tried setting up an automated build for the documentation over at [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org), but were not happy with what we achieved. If you want to give it a try yourself, feel free to do so.
