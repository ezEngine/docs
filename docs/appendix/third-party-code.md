Compile switch: **EZ_BUILD_PHYSX**

NVIDIA PhysX is used to provide collision detection, physics simulation, character controllers and other interactions.

To build PhysX yourself:

1. Checkout **https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX.git**
1. Goto **physx/buildtools/presets/public** and open all presets that you want to build and change or add\
\<cmakeSwitch name="NV_USE_STATIC_WINCRT" value="False" comment="Use the statically linked windows CRT" />\
\<cmakeSwitch name="NV_USE_DEBUG_WINCRT" value="True" comment="Use the debug version of the CRT" />
1. **Run physx/generate_projects.bat** for every configuration you want to build
1. Open **physx/compiler/.../PhysXSDK.sln** and compile **CMakePredefinedTargets/INSTALL** for both debug and release
1. Uwp installs are missing two include folders: **PhysX/include/cudamanager** and **PhysX/include/gpu** so copy those from **physx/include** to **physx/install/.../PhysX/include**
