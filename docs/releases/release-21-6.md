## Highlights / Major new Features

This release contains many improvements to existing features, such as the [RmlUi](../ui/rmlui.md) integration. Additionally, with this release EZ finally has a proper [skeletal animation system](../animation/skeletal-animation/skeletal-animation-overview.md). This is just the first version and will be expanded upon in the future.
