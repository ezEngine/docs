# Fog

By default a scene doesn't have any fog. To enable fog, you need to place a game object in the scene and attach a fog component.

## Fog Component

The *fog component* is used to apply simple depth-fog to the entire scene. The image below shows a scene without fog (left) with depth-fog (middle) and with an additional height-falloff (right):

The rotation and scale of the game object has no effect on the fog. The position is mostly irrelevant, except for the z-coordinate, which is used as the threshold if *HeightFalloff* is used.

* **Color:** The overall color of the fog.

* **Density:** The density of the fog. The higher this value, the thicker the fog will be and thus it will also become noticeable at a closer distance.

* **HeightFalloff:** If set to zero, the fog is applied equally everywhere in the scene. Otherwise, the fog will only be applied to objects *below* the fog object. Thus, in this case, the position of the fog object defines which objects will be inside the fog and which are outside. The *HeightFalloff* value defines the distance over which the height fog transitions from foggy ground to clear sky. For example, a value of `1` means the fog changes from fully foggy to non-foggy over one meter and thus gives a relatively sharp transition. A value of `10` results in a much larger and softer transition.
