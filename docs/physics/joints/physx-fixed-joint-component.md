# PhysX Fixed Joint Component

The *PhysX fixed joint component* is the most simple [joint](physx-joints.md) type. It links two [actors](../actors/physx-actors.md) together, such that they move in unison. If all you want is to merge two [shapes](../collision-shapes/physx-shapes.md), you should just attach them to the same actor. The main use case for fixed joints is to make them *breakable*.

Fixed joints can be used to set up very simple destructible objects.
