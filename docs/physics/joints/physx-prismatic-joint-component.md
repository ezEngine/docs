# PhysX Prismatic Joint Component

The *PhysX prismatic joint component* is a [joint](physx-joints.md) that links two actors such that they can only slide along one axis relative to each other.

Optionally, how for the joined actors can slide can be limited. 

## Component Properties

* [Shared Joint Component Properties](physx-joints.md#shared-joint-component-properties)

* `LimitMode`: Specifies whether the distance of sliding is limited and how.
  * `NoLimit`: The actors can slide unlimited far. Since they will still collide with other objects, there may be no need to limit the slide distance through the joint.
  * `HardLimit`: When the actors reach the end of the joint range, they will be stopped. In this mode `SpringStiffness` is a restitution value that defines how much the actor will bounce back. `SpringDamping` is a force theshold, if the actor hits the limit with less force than this, it will not bounce back, making it a bit sticky.
  * `SoftLimit`: When the actors pass the joint limits, they will not be stopped. Instead, a spring will start pulling them back together. In this mode `SpringStiffness` (`[0; inf]` range) defines how strongly the spring will pull the actors. `SpringDamping` dampens the spring, to prevent oscilation.
* `LowerLimit`, `UpperLimit`: How far the joined actors can move apart before being stopped or pulled back.
* `SpringStiffness`, `SpringDamping`: See `LimitMode`.
