# TypeScript Asset

Each *TypeScript asset* manages the script for a single [custom TypeScript component](custom-ts-components.md). You create a new TypeScript asset using *Editor > Create Document...*.

![TypeScript asset](media/ts-asset.png)

The document displays the script file contents as read-only. The document has no text editing functionality. The actual script code is stored in a separate `.ts` file, such that you can edit it with a regular text editor. After creating a new TypeScript asset, the `ScriptFile` property will have a default value for the `.ts` file. You can change this location, if you wish.

## Code Editing

The ezEditor assumes that you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed. When you click the VSC icon in the toolbar, it will launch Visual Studio Code with a workspace setup that includes all [data directories](../../projects/data-directories.md) of the [project](../../projects/projects-overview.md). It also makes sure that the referenced `ScriptFile` is created and filled out with some template code, if the file doesn't exist yet.

From there on, you can write the code in the external editor. Transforming the asset (`Ctrl+E`) will transpile the script and update the text preview.

## Script Parameters

In the asset properties you can add *variables*. Each variable has a name and a default value. After changing the variables you have to **transform** the script (toolbar button or `Ctrl+E`). This will insert the necessary code into the script. Make sure to not touch the markers for the auto-generated code section.

The variables that you add here will become [exposed parameters](../../scenes/exposed-parameters.md) for this script. Meaning, when this asset is used through a [TypeScript component](ts-component.md), the component can override the values of these variables. Thus you can instantiate the same script many times with different starting parameters.

## Non-Component TS Files

You can split up script code into multiple files, for example to easier share code between TS components. Simply create as many `.ts` files as you need and 'include' them as needed (using `require`). Having a *TypeScript asset* is **not required** for such files. TypeScript assets are only needed for the main TS files that represent a proper custom component type. The TypeScript assets are needed in the editor to be able to select the desired TS component code on a [TypeScript component](ts-component.md), and at runtime they are used to know how to instantiate the script. The assets are not used to identify which files to transpile. Instead, the editor will simply transpile *all* `.ts` files that it finds in any data directory of the project.
