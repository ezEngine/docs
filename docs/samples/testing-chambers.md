## Project

The editor project belonging to this sample can be found under *Data/Samples/Testing Chambers*.

Open the *Corridor* scene document. Make sure to transform all assets (in the *AssetBrowser* panel the box with the red arrow). Then press 'Play the Game' in the scene. Use WSAD to move around, left click to shoot, *Space* to jump, *CTRL* to crouch and *1, 2 and 3* to switch weapons.
