# LineCount Sample

The **LineCount Sample** is a command line application that counts the lines in source code and prints out some statistics.

## Prerequisites

**Note:** The sample is only available when the solution is built with **EZ_BUILD_SAMPLES** activated in CMake.

## Code

The LineCount sample shows how to create a basic application using the ezEngine framework. The code derives directly from ezApplication, as it does not implement any game functionality. It then shows how to setup the filesystem, and do basic operations with files, strings and logging.
