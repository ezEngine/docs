## Prerequisites

**Note:** The sample is only available when the solution is built with **EZ_BUILD_SAMPLES** activated in CMake.

## Code

The code shows how to use the EZ rendering API to set up buffers and textures, load shaders, etc. It also demonstrates how one can watch a directory for file changes and reload resources on the fly, to iterate on shaders.
