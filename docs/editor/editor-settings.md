# Editor Settings

Editor settings are user specific and independent of projects. They are stored in a OS user folder and thus are not checked into source control.

## Preferences

Preferences are user specific editor settings. Preferences may affect the entire editor application, only a certain [project](../projects/projects-overview.md), or even just a single [document](editor-documents.md).

The list on the left lists all the available preferences. Items prefixed with `Application:` affect the general editor, no matter which project is open. Items prefixed with `Project:` are specific to the currently open project and can be configured differently for other projects. Per-document preferences only show up while a document is open.

### Application: General

* **RestoreProjectOnStartup:** If enabled, the editor will load the project that was open the last time.

* **FieldOfView:** The FOV of the generic editor camera.

* **GizmoScale:** Allows you to change the size of the editor gizmos.

* **UsePrecompiledTools:** If enabled, the editor will prefer to use the tools under `Data\\Tools\\Precompiled`, rather than the ones from its own binary directory. The precompiled tools are built with maximum optimizations and are therefore typically faster, however, they only get updated infrequently and may not have all the latest features and bugfixes.

* **ExpandSceneTreeOnSelection:** If enabled, selecting an object in a scene will automatically expand the corresponding item in the scene tree view. If disabled, the scene tree will not change on selection from the viewport, and jumping to the selected tree item has to be done manually using `CTRL+T`.

## Shortcuts

*Editor > Editor Settings > Shortcuts...* opens a dialog to configure the shortcuts.

## Editor Plugins

*Editor > Editor Settings > Shortcuts...* opens a dialog that lists all active editor plugins. By default the editor will load all editor plugins. This dialog allows you to disable loading of certain plugins. This should only be done if a plugin is in conflict with some other plugin and you only need one of the two. For well behaving editor plugins there should be no need to disable them.

Please be aware that disabling the loading of an editor plugin is machine wide and thus will affect all projects equally.
