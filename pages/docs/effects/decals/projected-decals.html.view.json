Decals can be used to to apply text and other signs to geometry. The most common use-case, though, is to make scenes look more natural by simulating wear and tear, such as dirt and scratches. Decals can also be used to simulate dynamic surface imperfections like bullet holes, soot and blood spatters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-how-to-make-decals\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">Video: How to make decals</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtDagwkcTpU\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wtDagwkcTpU/0.jpg\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\" alt=\"video\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"decal-asset\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Decal Asset</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Before being able to place a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">decal component</em>, you must create a decal <a href=\"~/pages/docs/assets/assets-overview.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">asset</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decal-asset-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">Decal Asset Properties</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals/projected-decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">Mode:</strong> The mode specifies which surface properties (color, normal, occlusion/roughness/normal) the decal will affect.
