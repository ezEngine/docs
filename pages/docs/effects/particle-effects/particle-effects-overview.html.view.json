This is often the case for rocket exhaust effects, for example. Such behavior is hard to achieve with the way particle effects typically work, though, as each particle would need to have an extremely short life span and move very fast.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"129\">When enabling <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"129\">SimulateInLocalSpace</strong> in the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"129\">Effect tab</em>, the effect is simulated as if it was positioned at the world origin and with the default orientation. This removes any influence that the effects position, orientation and movement would otherwise have on the effect, as shown below:</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"131\"><video src=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/media/sim-local-space.webm\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\"></video></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"133\">Some behaviors won't properly work for effects that are simulated in local space. For example the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-behaviors.md#raycast-behavior\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"133\">raycast behavior</a> will do it's raycasts at the origin of the scene, rendering it pointless.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"135\">There is no performance benefit to using local space simulation. However, when using <a href=\"#shared-effects\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"135\">shared effects</a>, the shared state must be simulated in local space.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"137\">Other options to keep particles closer to the owning object are to use the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-behaviors.md#pull-along-behavior\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"137\">pull along behavior</a> or to <a href=\"#owner-velocity-inheritance\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"137\">inherit the owner velocity</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"owner-velocity-inheritance\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"139\">Owner Velocity Inheritance</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"141\">In the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"141\">Effect tab</em> there is a property <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"141\">ApplyOwnerVelocity</strong> which is a value between <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"141\">0</code> and <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"141\">1</code>. By default the value is zero, which means that all particles are initialized with either a zero velocity or with whatever some <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-initializers.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"141\">initializer</a> decided. In that case, particles will fly away from the emitter position unaffected by the velocity of the effect object itself. However, if the value is set to non-zero, a part of the velocity of the owning game object will be added to newly spawned particles.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"143\">This can be used for effects that may be spawned from moving objects and that shall retain some of that momentum. However, unless you additionally configure the effect to have some velocity damping (ie. using the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"143\">friction</em> property of the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-behaviors.md#velocity-behavior\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"143\">velocity behavior</a>), the particles will fly into that direction continuously, which may look weird, especially when the owner object changes direction or brakes, and the spawned particles overtake it.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"145\">Other options to keep particles closer to the owning object are to use the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-behaviors.md#pull-along-behavior\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"145\">pull along behavior</a> or to fully <a href=\"#local-space-simulation\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"145\">simulate in local space</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shared-effects\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"147\">Shared Effects</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"149\">Typically every particle effect in the world is simulated every frame. However, especially 'ambient' effects, such as the fire of wall torches, is often instantiated many, many times. You may only see a few of them at a time, but if all those effects were simulated every single frame, that would cost significant performance.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"151\">A solution to this problem is to use <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"151\">shared effects</em>. When an effect is set to be shared, it is simulated only once. All instances, that reference the effect will only be used to render the effect at their position. If not a single instance is visible, the simulation of the shared effect will even be paused.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"153\">There are two ways to make an effect shared. The global option is the <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"153\">AlwaysShared</strong> property which can be found in the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"153\">Effect tab</em>. If this is enabled, then all instances of the effect will always be shared. This should be used for ambient effects which are expected to be instantiated often and where simulating more than one has no benefit.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"155\">The second option is to set a <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"155\">SharedInstanceName</strong> on the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effect-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"155\">particle effect component</a>. All effect components that use the exact same <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"155\">shared instance name</em>, will share one simulation state and thus look identical. With this method, you can use a finite number of simulated effects, which allows you to have the same effect multiple times next to each other, without having them look identical, but still limiting how many effects need to be simulated.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"157\">Because the various instances have different positions and orientations, shared effects are always simulated in <a href=\"#local-space-simulation\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"157\">local space</a>. Effect sharing should mainly be used for continuous effects, and the effect should be authored to not be very distinctive. Also note that the rendering cost still has to be paid for every visible instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pre-simulation\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"159\">Pre-Simulation</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"161\">Some effects are supposed to always look as if they are constantly running. Mostly this is needed for ambient effects, such as torch fire or chimney smoke. The game may only spawn these effects when the player enters an area, but it is not desirable to see them getting started before they reach a stable simulation state. Instead, they should always already be in the state that they reach after a couple of seconds of simulation.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"163\">For such cases, you can use the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"163\">PreSimulationDuration</em> option from the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"163\">Effects tab</em>. When this is set to a couple of seconds, the first time an effect is simulated, it will be simulated multiple times, to reach the desired state.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"165\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"165\">Note:</strong> Pre-simulation obviously has a performance cost during the first simulation step. Therefore, keep the pre-simulation duration as low as possible.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"167\">Also be aware that for many ambient effects, that are instantiated a lot throughout a scene, prefer to use <a href=\"#shared-effects\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"167\">shared effects</a>. Pre-simulation may still be necessary to fix their very first appearance, though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"update-rate-when-invisible\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"169\">Update Rate When Invisible</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"171\">When a particle effect is not visible, it may still need to be updated, as the way that it changes may make it visible in the first place. For example the smoke of a smoke grenade that is behind the player may become visible when it is blown into the players view by the wind. It may be sufficient, though, to only update the effect ten times, or even just 5 times per second, while invisible. Thus reducing the computational overhead.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"173\">However, there are also effects which do not need to be updated, at all, when invisible. A waterfall effect, for instance, will always look similar. Thus once it is out of view, it can be simply paused.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"175\">And there are even effects that can be discarded entirely, when out of view. Bullet impact effects, for example, may be so small and have such a short life span, that there is no value in updating them at all, unless they are visible to begin with.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"177\">Which update method to use can be chosen from the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"177\">Effect tab</em> using the <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"177\">WhenInvisible</strong> property.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wind-influence\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"179\">Wind Influence</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"181\">Particles may be pushed by <a href=\"~/pages/docs/effects/wind/wind.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/particle-effects/particle-effects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"181\">wind</a>.
