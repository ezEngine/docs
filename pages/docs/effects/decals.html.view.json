Decals can be used to to apply text and other signs to geometry. The most common use-case, though, is to make scenes look more natural by simulating wear and tear, such as dirt and scratches. Decals can also be used to simulate dynamic surface imperfections like bullet holes, soot and blood spatters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-how-to-make-decals\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">Video: How to make decals</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtDagwkcTpU\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wtDagwkcTpU/0.jpg\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\" alt=\"video\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"decal-asset\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Decal Asset</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Before being able to place a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">decal component</em>, you must create a decal <a href=\"~/pages/docs/assets/assets-overview.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">asset</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decal-asset-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">Decal Asset Properties</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">Mode:</strong> The mode specifies which surface properties (color, normal, occlusion/roughness/normal) the decal will affect. If the mode is set to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">BaseColor</em> only, it will change the geometry's underlying color, but nothing else. If it is set to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">BaseColor, Normal</em>, it will also modify the surface's normal, etc.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">BlendModeColorize:</strong> If this is disabled, the decal's color texture will be applied 1:1 and the decal's alpha channel specifies the blend factor. If <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">BlendModeColorize</em> is true, the decal's color texture is used to 'change' the color of the underlying geometry, but not 'overwrite' it. A middle-grey value in the decal color texture means the decal will <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">not</em> change the underlying geometry color, at all. A darker value will darken the underlying geometry and a lighter value will lighten up the underlying color.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">This mode is useful for decals that should always darken or brighten the underlying geometry slightly, instead of overwriting the existing color and thus resulting in some fixed brightness.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">AlphaMask:</strong> An optional separate texture to specify the decal's alpha channel.

This can result in visible stretching along orthogonal axes. When <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">WrapAround</em> is enabled, the depth along the projection axis is used to modify the decal's UV coordinates. This trades less stretching, for other distortions. Enabling <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">WrapAround</em> may be useful for 'organic' decals, such as dirt and fluid spatters. For 'mechanical' decals, such as road signs, it should be disabled.

Thus it will 'adjust' the normal of the geometry and the direction from where the decal is projected has no influence on the final pixel normal. This is useful for decals that should act like a layer on top of some geometry, for example fluids and scratches.\nIf disabled, the decal will completely overwrite the normal of the underlying geometry and thus the direction from where the decal is projected has a significant influence. This is useful for decals that should show exactly from where they were projected, for example bullet holes.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"54\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"54\">InnerFadeAngle, OuterFadeAngle:</strong> When a decal is projected onto geometry at an angle (not straight down), the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"54\">inner fade angle</em> specifies at what angle the decal starts to fade out and the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"54\">outer fade angle</em> specifies at what angle the decal will be completely invisible.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"56\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"56\">FadeOutDelay, FadeOutDuration:</strong> If these are non-zero, the decal will fade out over <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"56\">FadeOutDuration</em> seconds starting after <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"56\">FadeOutDelay</em> seconds.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"58\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"58\">OnFinishedAction:</strong> If the decal component is set to fade out, it may delete itself or its entire owner object afterwards.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"60\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"60\">ApplyToDynamic:</strong> By default, decals apply to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"60\">static geometry</em> but not to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/effects/decals.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"60\">dynamic geometry</em>. If it is desired for a decal to be projected onto a dynamic object, this property should be used to select exactly to which dynamic object the decal should be applied to.
