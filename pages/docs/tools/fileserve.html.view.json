  "conceptual": "\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\">This is the GUI front-end and the server of the file-serving functionality. It is used to stream project data over a network to a connected (mobile) device.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\"><img src=\"~/pages/docs/tools/media/fileserve-app.png\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\" alt=\"FileServe application\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">Introduction</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\">On PCs there are no restrictions for file access and there is no deployment step required when you modify data or your application, which is why it is the most convenient platform to work with.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">However, many other platforms have very strict rules how to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">deploy</em> an application and which files they can access. Often you need to build a package that contains all the data, that your app may need to access. If you want to iterate on things, such as shaders, particle effects or level design, you have to repeat this lengthy process every single time, even though you only touch a few files.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Additionally, you may only work with a small test level, but if you also want to test with larger amounts of data every once in a while, your package needs to include all of this data, which can make the deployment step quite slow.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">To solve this issue, the EZ <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/filesystem.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">fileSystem</a> makes it possible to get its files not from the device itself, but instead streamed over a network connection, from a development PC. You then deploy a much smaller package, that contains nearly no data files, and have all files sent over on demand. Files are cached on the device, such that repeated accesses don't need to re-send unchanged files.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">This means creating and deploying app packages becomes much faster. Additionally, you can now utilize the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/resource-management.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">resource manager's</a> functionality to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">reload modified resources</em>. Therefore, you can modify any file on the development PC, and then hot-reload that data onto the device, without even restarting the app. And even in situations where you need to restart the app on the device, this is still much faster than having to do a full re-deployment.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">Note that there is also <a href=\"~/pages/docs/tools/inspector.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">ezInspector</a>, that you can also connect to your remote app, so that you can get additional insights, such as the log output.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-enable-fileserve-functionality\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">How to Enable Fileserve Functionality</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">Generally the fileserve functionality is added to the engine through the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">ezFileservePlugin</code>. Enabling it is thus just a matter of loading that plugin during engine initialization. If your game is built on top of <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">ezGameApplication</code> (such as <a href=\"~/pages/docs/tools/player.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">ezPlayer</a>), it is automatically enabled in development builds for platforms that have file access restrictions (see <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">ezGameApplication::Init_LoadRequiredPlugins()</code> for details). This is also true for <a href=\"~/pages/docs/tools/inspector.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">ezInspector</a> support.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">If your game is <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/application/application.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">using a custom application class</a>, make sure this is set up in your code. The <a href=\"~/pages/samples/shader-explorer.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">Shader Explorer Sample</a> is such an application and should be used as reference.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">If you want more control over the fileserve connection in your application, have a look at <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">ezFileserveClient</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shader-explorer-sample\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"29\">Shader Explorer Sample</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">The <a href=\"~/pages/samples/shader-explorer.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">Shader Explorer Sample</a> is great to try out the fileserve functionality. In <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">ShaderExplorer.h</code> you can find the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">#define USE_FILESERVE</code>, which is <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">OFF</code> by default, but can be easily forced to <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">ON</code> even when running on a PC. This is useful to try out fileserve on the same machine, and verify that it works in general.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ezfileserve-application\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"33\">The ezFileServe Application</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\"><em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">ezFileServe</em> is the GUI application that provides the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">server</em> functionality. It has to run on the PC that has access to the game's data.</p>\n<blockquote sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\">\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\">IMPORTANT</strong></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\">ezFileServe needs to know where the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\">project specific</em> data for your game is, ie where the main project folder is. Thus it can only serve data for one specific project at a time. If this path is not provided through a command line argument, it will ask for it right at startup. If you cancel this, or select the wrong folder, clients can connect, but will fail to find their files.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ezfileserve-ui\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">ezFileserve UI</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">At the very top it displays the detected network adaptors. This may be important to know, if you need to configure firewalls to let traffic through to this device.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">Below that, it lists the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">special directories</em>. Some of these are automatically set. The <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">project</strong> special directory is the most important one for the client to find its files. If you try different apps on a device, be certain that you restart ezFileserve and set the correct project path each time. Special directories are typically provided through the command line <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">-specialdirs</code>. If you launch ezFileserve from the editor (<em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">Tools &gt; Launch Fileserve...</em>) it automatically sets this. If it is not provided, ezFileserve will ask for a project folder at startup.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\">Further down there are three tabs:</p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">Activity</strong>: This is a log of all activity.

This enables shader compilation on the host PC, for platforms that do not support shader compilation on device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reloading-resources\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"57\">Reloading Resources</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"59\">In the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"59\">Activity</em> tab there is a button <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"59\">Trigger Reload Resources</strong>. This instructs the connected clients to reload all changed resources. Use this, if you modified a file on the PC, such as a shader, and want to see the change on device without restarting the app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connect-to-client\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"61\">Connect To Client</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"63\">The button at the bottom shows a dialog that asks you for the IP address of a device that you want to connect to. Try this out, if you have issues getting a network connection between your devices. Often devices have multiple different IP addresses, depending through which network adapters they are reachable. If in doubt, try all of them.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"65\">For more information, see <a href=\"#connecting-to-ezfileserve\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"65\">Connecting to ezFileServe</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ezfileserve-command-line-arguments\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"67\">ezFileserve Command Line Arguments</h3>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"69\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"69\"><p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"69\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"69\">-fs_port XYZ</code>: By default ezFileserve uses <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"69\">port 1042</strong>.

The most common use case is that games mount the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"71\">&gt;project</code> folder and the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"71\">&gt;sdk/Data/Base</code> folder, using <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"71\">&gt;project</code> and <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"71\">&gt;sdk</code> as the respective <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"71\">special directories</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"73\"><p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"73\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/tools/fileserve.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"73\">-fs_close_timeout seconds</code>: If given, the application automatically shuts down when no client is connected anymore and a certain timeout is reached.
