All nodes that shall affect the result must ultimately be connected to an output node.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">The <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">pose result</em> nodes do not define the final result, though. Rather the final result is a mix of all poses that reach a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">pose result</em> node. This makes it easier to set up many different animations and also split work up into several animation graphs.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">You can quickly deactivate an entire part of the graph by removing the connection to the output node. Nodes that are not connected to the output are not evaluated at runtime and therefore don't cost any performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pose-result-node\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\">Pose Result Node</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">The <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">pose result</em> node is used to output <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">one</em> animation result. A more complex animation graph will contain many pose result nodes. All poses from <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">active</em> pose result nodes (the ones that have a non-zero <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Target Weight</code>) will be combined according to their weight.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Usually you would set up the graph such, that all actions that could overlap flow into their own pose result nodes. For example you may have one sub graph that is responsible for walk animations and another one for jump animations. When jumping, the system should fade over from walking into jumping and thus there is a short duration of overlap. To achieve this, both sub graphs would have their own <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">pose result</em> node and when the jump starts, the jump sub graph fades its output in (by setting its <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Target Weight</code> to <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">1</code>) and the walk sub graph fades its pose out respectively. The animation system takes care of combining the output poses accoring to their current weight.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">Now consider that you may have two different jump animations, one for when the character is standing and one while it is walking. These cases are mutually exclusive, and thus there is no need for separate output nodes for the two jump styles. In this case one would rather use one of the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-pose-blending.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">pose blending nodes</a> to select the desired jump animation and feed it into one output node.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">However, you <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">could</em> use different pose result nodes, regardless, if it is easier to set up the animation this way, there is no performance penalty for using additional nodes as long as the number of simultaneously active nodes is low.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">Node Properties</h3>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">Fade Duration</code>: How long to fade the result pose in or out when the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">Target Weight</code> changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"input-pins\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">Input Pins</h3>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\"><p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">Pose</code>: The pose to combine with all other active pose results.</p>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\"><p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-output.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">Target Weight</code>: How strongly to apply the pose to the output.
