Just left click and drag from one output pin to another input pin. The UI will display which pins can be connected once you start dragging. Since every pin represents a certain data type, only compatible pin types may get connected.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">Some pins allow to connect to multiple other pins, or have multiple incoming connections.

From the drop down you select the name of the animation. If the desired animation name doesn't exist yet, use the <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\"><edit values...></edit></strong> option to add one. These names are used throughout your project to identify animations and should be chosen carefully. Select an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-clip-asset.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">animation clip asset</a> to map from the animation name to the clip.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\">In the animation graph you never select animation clips directly, but rather always choose the animation by name. Because the mapping is defined in one central place in the animation graph asset, it is easy to replace an animation by another clip, simply by changing the mapping.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\">In the future this feature is also meant to be used to switch between entirely different animation sets and be able to reuse an animation graph between different creatures and different skeletons. This is, however, not yet implemented, but if necessary, can already be emulated to some degree using graph composition (see next section).</p>\n<h2 id=\"compositing-animation-graphs\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">Compositing Animation Graphs</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">An animation graph may reference another animation graph, to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">include</em> the functionality of that graph in itself. This makes it possible to define different animation setups over multiple animation graph assets, making editing easier and making it possible to share certain animations between different graphs.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">When one graph includes another graph, the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">animation clip mapping</em> of the parent graph takes precedence over the included graph, which allows to override the mapping of the included graph.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-animation-graph-assets\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\">Using Animation Graph Assets</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">Once an animation graph asset is set up, it can be applied to an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animated-mesh-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">animated mesh</a> by adding an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-controller-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">animation controller component</a> to the same game object. The component will evaluate the graph in every update, and send the final animation pose to the animated mesh.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"51\">To control what the animation controller does, you may also need a <a href=\"~/pages/docs/Miscellaneous/blackboards.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"51\">blackboard</a> for storing state, and potentially a script component to decide when which animation should be active.</p>\n<h2 id=\"see-also\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\">See Also</h2>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"55\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"55\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/skeletal-animation-overview.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"55\">Skeletal Animations</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"56\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-controller-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"56\">Animation Controller Component</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"57\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/Miscellaneous/blackboards.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"57\">Blackboards</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"58\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/simple-animation-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"58\">Simple Animation Component</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
