These names are used throughout your project to identify animations and should be chosen carefully. Select an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-clip-asset.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\">animation clip asset</a> to map from the animation name to the clip.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">In the animation graph you never select animation clips directly, but rather always choose the animation by name. Because the mapping is defined in one central place in the animation graph asset, it is easy to replace an animation by another clip, simply by changing the mapping.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">Animation mapping is meant to enable you to reuse an animation graph between different creatures. Using graph composition (see next section) you can set up a an animation graph that does the same as another graph, but uses different animation clips for the same actions. For example a regular human and a zombie could share the same animation graph logic for walking, running, etc, but of course the zombie animations would look different. The mapping can also be overridden on the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-controller-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">animation controller component</a>, both statically, as well as at runtime (via code). This could, for instance, be used to use one animation graph for all the weapon-handling behavior, but when the player switches the active weapon, a script can remap all the animation clips, such that they work for another weapon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compositing-animation-graphs\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">Compositing Animation Graphs</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\">An animation graph may reference another animation graph, to <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\">include</em> the functionality of that graph in itself. This makes it possible to define different animation setups over multiple animation graph assets, making editing easier and making it possible to share certain animations between different graphs.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">When one graph includes another graph, the <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">animation clip mapping</em> of the parent graph takes precedence over the included graph, which allows to override the mapping of the included graph.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-animation-graph-assets\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"51\">Using Animation Graph Assets</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\">Once an animation graph asset is set up, it can be applied to an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animated-mesh-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\">animated mesh</a> by adding an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-controller-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/animation-graph-asset.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\">animation controller component</a> to the same game object.
