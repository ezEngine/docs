You give it a 2D coordinate, and it will determine which <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-clip-asset.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\">animation clips</a> are relevant and mix them together with proper weights depending on how close the coordinate is to each clip.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">The purpose of this node is to generate a continuous animation space from just a few discrete clips. This is often used for locomotion, where you only have animation clips for walking into a fixed number of directions and at certain speeds, but you'd like to be able to move a character into any direction and at any speed in between.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\"><video src=\"~/pages/docs/animation/media/anim-mix2d.webm\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" autoplay loop></video></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\">This node can generally be used to combine animations that can be thought of as having a position on a 2D plane. For example if you have animations for aiming forwards, to the left, right, up and down, you can use the blendspace 2D node to generate any pose in between.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Be aware that the poses will be combined linearly, though. If the poses from two clips are too different, the result may not look very good. In this case it is best to create additional clips with in-between poses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">How To Use</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">You add multiple animation clips and give each clip a position (<code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">X</code> and <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">Y</code>). As with the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace1d.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">blendspace 1D node</a>, the playback of all clips is synchronized, meaning that the length of each clip may differ, but they will be played back such that they start and end in unison. That means your clips must be authored accordingly, so for example for locomotion all clips should start with the left foot forwards, then move the right foot forwards, then the left again. From that point on the clips will be looped.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">What the coordinates represent is up to you. For locomotion you could say that <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">X</code> represents left/right movement and <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">Y</code> forwards/backwards. You would then position a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">walk left</em> clip at <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">(-1, 0)</code> a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">walk right</em> clip at <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">(+1, 0)</code> a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">walk forward</em> clip at <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">(0, +1)</code> and a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">run forward</em> clip at <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">(0, +2)</code>.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">Through the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">X</code> and <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">Y</code> input pins you provide a 2D coordinate. During testing you may hook this up directly to an <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-input.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">input node</a>, though later you'll probably need more control.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">The node will then take that input coordinate to decide which clips should be used with what influence, and mix them together to a single output pose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"node-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">Node Properties</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">Most node properties are the same as on the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-sample-clip.md#node-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">sample clip node</a>.</p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\"><p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">Input Response</code>: A time duration over which changes to the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">X</code> and <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/skeletal-animation/animation-graphs/anim-nodes-blendspace2d.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">Y</code> input values are applied.
