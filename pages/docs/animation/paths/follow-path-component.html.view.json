Movement is with constant speed and strictly along the path. It can be used for moving effects (lights, particles) around, where the mechanical behavior may not be too obvious, but for things like camera paths or anything else that should have natural acceleration, it won't be sufficient.</p>\n<h2 id=\"component-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Component Properties</h2>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Path</code>: The object on which the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/animation/paths/spline-component.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">spline</a> to use is attached. If none is provided, the parent objects are searched for an object that contains a spline component. That means you can put an object into a <a href=\"~/pages/docs/prefabs/prefabs-overview.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">prefab</a> and then place it onto different splines by adding the prefab instance as a child of the spline shape.</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"14\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"14\">StartDistance</code>: At what distance along the path to start traversing it.

It is also automatically set to false, when the end of the path is reached and no looping behavior is active.</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"16\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"16\">Mode</code>: Whether to traverse the path in a loop or only once.</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">Speed</code>: How fast to move along the path.</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"18\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"18\">LookAhead</code>: The component will rotate the object according to the path direction. For this it samples the path some distance ahead. The farther the look-ahead the earlier the object will rotate into upcoming curves. At a very low look-ahead, it will rotate very rigidly.</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/animation/paths/follow-path-component.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">Smoothing</code>: With zero smoothing the position of the object will be exactly that of the path. With some smoothing, the position doesn't change as abruptly.
