Basically this option is used to reference any object, and tell the constraint that the position and orientation of that object should be the anchor point where the constraint acts upon the child actor. For most constraint types this is rarely needed. If you link two actors with a hinge constraint, the position of the constraint already defines where between the actors the hinge will be.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"64\">However, this setup always assumes that the two actors should start out in the 'default configuration' of the constraint. For example, for a hinge constraint with a stiff spring, the default configuration is when it is fully relaxed, meaning you could not put them into a start configuration where the constraint is already under tension.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"66\">Similarly, for a distance constraint, the child actor would always need to start out such that the constraint position is exactly at the position of the actor, where it should link to the actor. This can be problematic especially when the distance constraint uses a <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"66\">minimum distance</em>, as the constraint would immediately push away the actor, potentially with high speed.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"68\">Using a dedicated object to specify the anchor point, both situations can be fixed. The anchor point specifies the position at which the constraint affects the child actor. For most constraint types the rotation of the anchor point is important as well. If the anchor's transform is identical to the constraint's transform, it is redundant and could be left out. However, if it is different from the constraint's transform, this difference tells the constraint how much its start state deviates from the 'default configuration'. For example for a hinge constraint the position of the anchor should always be identical to the constraint's position, otherwise the child actor will jerk towards the hinge constraint at startup. However, the rotation may deviate from the constraint's rotation, which specifies how much the constraint is already rotated at startup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"video-how-to-use-the-anchor-property\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"70\">Video: How to use the Anchor Property</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"72\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnQEaA8E0SM\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"72\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/xnQEaA8E0SM/0.jpg\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"72\" alt=\"video\"></a></p>\n<blockquote sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"74\">\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"74\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"74\">Note:</strong></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"76\">In the video we use PhysX joint components, but the concepts are identical for Jolt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"shared-constraint-component-properties\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"78\">Shared Constraint Component Properties</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"80\">These properties are shared among all joint types:</p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"82\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"82\"><code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/physics/jolt/constraints/jolt-constraints.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"82\">PairCollision</code>: If disabled, joined actors will not collide with each other.
