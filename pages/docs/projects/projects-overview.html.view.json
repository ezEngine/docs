  "conceptual": "\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\">The term <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\">project</em> refers to one game or application, its global settings, and all its data. The editor distinguishes between projects, and allows you to configure various options of each one. On the runtime side, however, the concept of a project does not exist, the current state of the runtime represents the project. Therefore, when you switch to a different project in the editor, the engine will in fact be shut down completely and restarted with different settings (editor and engine are two separate processes).</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-how-to-create-a-project\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">Video: How to create a project</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wskaNSRbzE\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5wskaNSRbzE/0.jpg\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\" alt=\"video\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-project\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\">Creating a Project</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">You can use ezEngine entirely without the editor. In that case, you do not need to create a project, at all. Your <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/application/application.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">application</a> is your project and you set up things like the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/filesystem.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">fileSystem</a>, the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/custom-code/cpp/engine-plugins.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">plugins</a> and so on, entirely from code.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">It is more convenient, though, to maintain your project through the editor. To create a new project, open the editor's <a href=\"~/pages/docs/editor/dashboard.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">dashboard</a> (<em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Project &gt; Show Dashboard</em>) and select <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">New</strong> from the top-right corner:</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\"><img src=\"~/pages/docs/editor/media/dashboard-projects.png\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\" alt=\"Dashboard\"></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">The dialog will ask you to select a <strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">new folder</strong> for your project:</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\"><img src=\"~/pages/docs/projects/media/editor-create-project.png\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\" alt=\"Create a Project\"></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">The name of the folder represents the name of your project. This name is stored nowhere else, you can rename your project later simply by renaming the folder.</p>\n<h3 id=\"basic-setup\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">Basic Setup</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">Now you have a new, blank project. The first thing you should do is to check the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/project-settings.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">project settings</a>. Specifically, if you want to share assets between multiple projects, you need to put those assets into a dedicated folder and then add that folder to your project as a <a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/data-directories.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">data directory</a>.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">The second thing you should check is which <a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/plugin-selection.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\">plugins</a> you want to use, so that you have all desired features available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-scene\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"29\">Create a Scene</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">Select <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">File &gt; Create...</em> and create a <a href=\"~/pages/docs/editor/editor-documents.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">document</a> of type <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"31\">ezScene</code>. The new scene will be filled with some default objects and you should see something like this:</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"33\"><img src=\"~/pages/docs/projects/media/new-project-scene.jpg\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"33\" alt=\"New Scene\"></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">If you don't see the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/assets/asset-browser.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">asset browser</a>, make sure to open it. You can now <a href=\"~/pages/docs/scenes/scene-editing.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">edit your scene</a>. When you need more assets to play with, you need to <a href=\"~/pages/docs/assets/import-assets.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">import them</a> into your project. Once you have something in your scene that could <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">do something</em>, you can <a href=\"~/pages/docs/editor/run-scene.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">test your scene</a>. A good starting point for that is to simply attach a <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">Rotor</code> component to a mesh. A fun next step is to let objects fall down using <a href=\"~/pages/docs/physics/jolt/jolt-overview.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">physics</a> (hint: you need a <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">Dynamic Actor</code> component and a <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"35\">Box Shape</code> component)</p>\n<blockquote sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\">\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"37\">TIP</strong></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\">If you want new documents to always be populated with some default state, have a look at <a href=\"~/pages/docs/editor/editor-template-documents.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"39\">template documents</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"project-wide-options\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">Project-wide options</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">Plugins may add project wide options.
