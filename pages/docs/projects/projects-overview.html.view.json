  "conceptual": "\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\">The term <em sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"3\">project</em> refers to one game or application, its global settings, and all its data. The editor distinguishes between projects, and allows you to configure various options of each one. On the runtime side, however, the concept of a project does not exist, the current state of the runtime represents the project. Therefore, when you switch to a different project in the editor, the engine will in fact be shut down completely and restarted with different settings (editor and engine are two separate processes).</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-how-to-create-a-project\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">Video: How to create a project</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\"><strong sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">Note:</strong> This video is slightly outdated, as there is now a creation wizard that makes things even easier.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wskaNSRbzE\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5wskaNSRbzE/0.jpg\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\" alt=\"video\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-project\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Creating a Project</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">You can use ezEngine entirely without the editor. In that case, you do not need to create a project, at all. Your <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/application/application.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">application</a> is your project and you set up things like the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/runtime/filesystem.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">fileSystem</a>, the <a href=\"~/pages/docs/custom-code/cpp/engine-plugins.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">plugins</a> and so on, entirely from code.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">It is more convenient, though, to maintain your project through the editor. To create a new project, select <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\">Project &gt; Create Project...</code>.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">A creation wizard will show up:</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\"><img src=\"~/pages/docs/projects/media/project-wizard-1.png\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\" alt=\"Create a Project\"></p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\">Choose a name for your project and a location where it should be stored.

This can be adjusted later.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">The editor will create a default 'Main' <a href=\"~/pages/docs/scenes/scene-editing.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">scene</a> for you, but other than that, only the assets from the <code sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">Base</code> <a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/data-directories.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\">data directory</a> are available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-wide-options\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\">Project-Wide Options</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">You should be aware of these <a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/project-settings.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"45\">project settings</a>, at some point you may need to adjust them for your purposes.</p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/data-directories.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"47\">Data directories</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"48\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/custom-code/cpp/engine-plugins.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"48\">Engine plugins</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/physics/jolt/collision-shapes/jolt-collision-layers.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"49\">Collision layers</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"50\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/project-settings.md#input-configuration\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"50\">Input Configuration</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"51\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/tags.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"51\">Tags</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"52\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/project-settings.md#window-configuration\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"52\">Window Configuration</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/assets/asset-profiles.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"53\">Asset profiles</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"55\">Plugins may add additional options.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"57\">Usually you should copy all required assets directly into your project folder, but in case that you want to share assets between multiple projects, you can put those assets into a dedicated folder and add that folder to your project as a <a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/data-directories.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"57\">data directory</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"see-also\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"59\">See Also</h2>\n<ul sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"61\">\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"61\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/data-directories.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"61\">Data Directories</a></li>\n<li sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"62\"><a href=\"~/pages/docs/projects/plugin-selection.md\" sourcefile=\"pages/docs/projects/projects-overview.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"62\">Plugin Selection</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
